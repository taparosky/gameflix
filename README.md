# Description

This project was developed based on the HTML/CSS course taught by Felipe Aguiar at <a href="https://web.dio.me/">Digital Innovation One</a> website. The purpose of 
this project was to develop my HTML5 and CSS skills trying to mimic Netflix front-end, but changing the main theme from the site from movies & series to games. 

- `Feature 1`: Navbar with buttons to navigate to the other pages
- `Feature 2`: Main game cover with a descrition and two buttons
- `Feature 3`: Games carousel developed with Jquery
- `Feature 4`: Responsiveness
